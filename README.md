SpaceShooter
============

Space shooter is a simple spaceship shooter game with asteroids-style control.
Pressing up accelerates your ship in the direction it is facing; pressing down
accelerates your ship in the direction opposite the way it is facing.  Left and
right spin the ship, but do not alter your velocity.  Spacebar shoots.  The
player and enemies wrap around the sides of the level.

Enemies appear from the sides in each level.  When you destroy all enemies, you
move to the next level.  Depending on the difficulty selected, some enemies
will drop powerups that give you better/faster weapons, more shields, or extra
lives.  You can collect powerups by colliding with them or by shooting them
with the ship's main laser.  (Missiles do not collect powerups.)  Missiles can
be destroyed with laser shots, but laser shots cannot be stopped.
