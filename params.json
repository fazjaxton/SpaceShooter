Left and\r\nright spin the ship, but do not alter your velocity.  Spacebar shoots.  The\r\nplayer and enemies wrap around the sides of the level.\r\n\r\nEnemies appear from the sides in each level.  When you destroy all enemies, you\r\nmove to the next level.  Depending on the difficulty selected, some enemies\r\nwill drop powerups that give you better/faster weapons, more shields, or extra\r\nlives.  You can collect powerups by colliding with them or by shooting them\r\nwith the ship's main laser.  (Missiles do not collect powerups.)  Missiles can\r\nbe destroyed with laser shots, but laser shots cannot be stopped.\r\n\r\nPlaying\r\n=======\r\n\r\nSpaceShooter is written in the LOVE 2D game engine based on the Lua language.\r\nTo play on Windows or Mac, you can download the prebuilt file for your\r\nplatform.
